# _Sample project_

This is your first project with ESP-IDF here, you'd to access vs-code, pressed ctrl+shift+p to create a new simple project with board ESP32 WROOVER 3.3V
    - You'd to choose "Create project using template simple project"
    - You pressed "Yes" in the botton-left part of screen monitor
    - You'd to access "ESP-IDF" cmd window and used "idf.py build" and "idf.py -p COM13 flash monitor"



## How to use example
We encourage the users to use the example as a template for the new projects.
A recommended way is to follow the instructions on a [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project).

## Example folder contents

The project **sample_project** contains one source file in C language [main.c](main/main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```
Additionally, the sample project contains Makefile and component.mk files, used for the legacy Make based build system. 
They are not used or needed when building with CMake and idf.py.
